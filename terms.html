<p>By accessing or using the Service You agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If You disagree with any part of these Terms and Conditions then You may not access the Service.</p>

<h1><strong>Service overview</strong></h1>


<p>Service provides 2 main features. 1) End User identification and 2) creation of electronic signatures by End User for the Customer using Security Devices. Service exists to make these features
    easier and more accessible for everyone. Security devices are built by 3rd parties for the purpose of user identification and electronic signatures. </p>


<p>End User must consider that the Personal Data they provide via their eID methods will be forwarded to the Customer, and hence a separate personal data processing relationship is formed between
    Customer and End User. This relationship between the Customer and End User is not governed by us, and we do not take any responsibility for the Customer’s actions with the End User’s data.</p>


<p>End User understands that if he/she clicks action buttons which initiate user identification or electronic signatures and enters credentials for security device, for example PIN codes or
    passwords, then Service will read data from there and forwards this data to the Customer. User identification and electronic signatures created have legal effects so End User must consult with
    specialists if not entirely sure what is happening.</p>
